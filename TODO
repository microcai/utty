Short Term: Things *must* be implemented, orded

Complete TTY set of IOCTLs support, so top can work

Complete keyborad support, like CTRL-C send SIGTERM, so can do real work

VT MASTER support, co-exist with X (will be removed then X dead)

Color Support, be more friendly

Mouse Support, emulate gpm interface. no gpm daemon need to be started


Long term:

Right to left reading support

Client as a System compositor
